        Angelina DiFrancesco was born on May 22, 1990 under the sign of Gemini. 
        She grew up in Wilmington, Delaware where she attended Ursuline Academy 1st-8th grade. 
        After the 3rd grade, Ursuline became an all girls school, which sucked because Angelina lost 
        all her friends who would play Pokemon with her during recess. In middle school, she had a 
        huge goth phase which pretty much stuck for the most part. For high school, she attended 
        Archmere Academy, where she met her best friend Cait Person (now Cait Ferranto). 
        Angelina is especially fortunate because her best friend from high school, Cait, married 
        her best friend from college, Jake. Most people think she introduced them, but she 
        actually had nothing to do with it.</p>
        <p> Angelina attended the University of Delaware, where she changed her major 4 times 
            before deciding to pursue fashion. Sadly, this added 2 additional years to her 
            undergrad experience, so she was a super duper senior. Lucky for her, in-state 
            tuition and an academic scholarship helped to minimize the damages. Throughout college, 
            Angelina had some amazing opportunities to travel to study in other parts of the world. 
            Spending time in Hawaii, Paris, and Hong Kong all broadened her world view and helped 
            to shape her into a global citizen.</p>
        <p> Angelina finally earned a B.S. in Fashion Merchandising and a Minor in Sociology in 2014. 
            After college, she moved to New York City where she worked as a sourcing coordinator for a 
            fashion company. Currently, she lives in Philadelphia 
            with her cat, Phoebe.</p>
