        <p>Angelina DiFrancesco was born on May 22, 1990 under the sign of Gemini. 
            She grew up in Wilmington Delaware where she attended Ursuline Academy 1st-8th grade.
            After the 3rd grade, Ursuline became an all girls school, which sucked because Angelina lost all her friends who would play Pokemon with her during recess.
            In middle school, she had a huge goth phase which pretty much stuck for the most part.
            For high school, she attended Archmere Academy, where she met her best friend Cait Person (now Cait Ferranto).
            Angelina is especially fortunate because her best friend from high school, Cait, married her best friend from college, Jake.
            Most people think she introduced them, but she actually had nothing to do with it.</p>
        <p> Angelina graduated from the University of Delaware with a B.S. in Fashion Merchandising and a Minor in Sociology.
            Currently, she lives in NoLibs with her cat, Phoebe.</p>
